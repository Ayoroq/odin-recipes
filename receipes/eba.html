    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe describes how to make the Nigerian dish Eba.</p>
    <p>Eba is enjoyed all over Nigeria and can be had with just about every soup available</p>
    <p>My favourite is Eba with Egusi, but you can enjoy with Efo, Ila, Banga soup, Ewedu and many more.</p>

    <p>Garri is prepared with the following ingredients</p>
    <ul>

    <ol>

      <li>Transfer some of the boiled water to the second bowl from the ingredients list</li>
      <li>Now, add the Garri gently and make sure to stir at the same time.</li>
